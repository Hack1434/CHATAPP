The project follows a structured development process aimed at creating a chat application using React, Tailwind CSS, and WebSocket technology. Here's a breakdown of the project's phases without timestamps:

Introduction:

The project starts with an introduction, setting the stage for what will be covered.
Installing React and Tailwind CSS:

The initial setup involves installing React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework.
Login and Register:

Users are provided with functionality to log in or register for the chat application, presumably using credentials.

Fetching History Messages from the Database:

Historical messages from the database are fetched and displayed, allowing users to view past conversations.
Auto Re-connecting:

Mechanisms are implemented to automatically reconnect users in case of disconnections, ensuring continuous communication.
Displaying Messages from the Database:

Messages retrieved from the database are displayed in the chat interface, enriching the user experience.
Online Indicator & Showing Offline People:

User status indicators, such as online and offline indicators, are implemented to provide visibility into user availability.
Killing Old Connections:

Processes for terminating old connections are implemented to manage resource usage efficiently.
Logout Button & Showing Username of Logged-in User:

A logout button is added to facilitate user logout, and the username of the logged-in user is displayed for identification purposes.
Attachments / File Upload:

Functionality is added to allow users to attach and upload files during conversations.
Fixing Small Display Bug:

Minor display bugs are identified and fixed to ensure a polished user interface.
